No, really, How will you use methods in your game? Why?
I will use methods to track the players Progress and which paths they choose.

Be specific.
I will use the methods to help the player follow a path that they can use to loose or win the game.

What values will you pass to them.
I will pass values that can keep them alive or kill them.
