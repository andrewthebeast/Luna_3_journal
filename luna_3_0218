Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
	public Player() throws SlickException {
    	SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
            	"res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
    	up = new Animation();
    	up.setAutoUpdate(true);
    	up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
    	up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
    	up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
    	up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
    	up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
    	up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
   	up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
    	up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
    	up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);

This code makes the animation for the character when they move in the up 
direction.

Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what 
are the skills we were trying to practice?
It would be unrealistic because slick does it for us and we will eventually 
memorize it by doing it over again and again.
