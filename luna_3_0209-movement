How can / will you make the orb move in the direction you are facing?
I will make the orb move with me by setting up an animation for it and setting
different ids fior the animations for it.

Explain and provide specific code.
I will make a sprite sheet for it and make it interfear with th e way the 
player moves.
Example code:
if (input.isKeyDown(Input.KEY_3)) {
            isattacking = true;
            if (Player.direction == 1) {
                player.sprite = orb1.right;
}
