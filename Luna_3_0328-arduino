So are the declaring variables.

What code adaptations have you made? [Or will you make if none to date. Note: 'none' is not a valid answer]
I can adapt to different coding programs pretty easily but mabey some other things will be different.

What is required for a circuit?
To build a curit you need a RedBoard and a Breadboard, and wires and resistors along with the other supplies

How are programs compiled with Arduino?
