How would you change the first value of the int array to 42?
int[] num = new int[1];
num = 42;

Of the String array to "Bob"?
boolean[] bobby = new boolean[];
bobby = (“Bob”)

What does this do: private String[] dessert = new String[3];
This makes 3 strings of desserts.

What does this do: private String[] postres = {"rice pudding", "pan dulce",
 "bunuelos"}
This makes a string of 3 different arrays.

How are they different?

How would we replace "bunuelos" with "apple pie"
Enter “apple pie” instead of “bunuelos” in the code.
