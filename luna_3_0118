What slick game did you create?
I have not yet finished my slick game.

What challenges did you solve?
I have solved some challenges like getting the map to work and fixing my character.

Before the Winter break, you were admonished to finish your maps and spritesheets - so that you would be ready to go with the game when we got back. Did you? Why or why not?
I did not finish my map or character over or before the break because i was not completely focused.

Were you able to meet the timeline? Why or why not? [Focus on what you did or did not do. Journals ascribing blame to others will not be considered.]
I was not able to meet the timeline because I was not completely finished with my game and I did not take all of the right steps to complete the game.
