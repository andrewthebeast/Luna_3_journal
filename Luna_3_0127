How do you add an image to a slick game?
To add an image you have to make a class for it then declare the images 
location in the res folder and then make a variable for it. Then you draw the
image make a hitbox for it and declare the coordinates for it.

Where is the image drawn? [What code? Be specific.]
The image is drawn in the item class and is pasted below.

class Item {

    public int x;
    public int y;
    public boolean isvisible = true;
    Image currentImage;
    Shape hitbox;
    Image healthpotion = new Image("res/tunnle.jpeg");

    Item(int a, int b) throws SlickException {
        this.x = a;
        this.y = b;
        this.hitbox = new Rectangle(a, b, 32, 32);// 64 is the width of the item
        this.currentImage = healthpotion;

    }
