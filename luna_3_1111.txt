In your game, what challenges must your player solve?
In my game my player must find out who to make friends or enemys with and 
see if he can survive this crisis that he is in.

How will you specifically track whether they have been solved?
I will track what challenges they complete by setting a method to.

Provide variable names and types. Classes if applicable.
 I dont have any right now.
